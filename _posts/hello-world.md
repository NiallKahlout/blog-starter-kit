Hello, my name is Niall Kahlout üëã

Welcome to my blog! 

I'm a cybersecurity and digital forensics graduate with a strong passion for technology, security, and building innovative projects. Over the years, I've explored various areas of tech, from securing systems to developing practical applications.

This blog serves as my personal space to document my journey, share insights, and connect with like-minded individuals.

## Background & Education

I hold a Level 8 degree in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics from Technological University Dublin, where I developed expertise in network security, ethical hacking, digital investigations, and threat analysis. My education provided me with a strong foundation in secure system design, penetration testing, and forensic methodologies, enabling me to effectively tackle modern cyber threats.

I have also earned the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, further reinforcing my knowledge in security best practices, risk management, incident response, and cloud security.

Beyond academics, I am highly committed to continuous learning. I actively set up home labs for security testing, conduct vulnerability assessments, and work on real-world cybersecurity challenges to keep my skills sharp and up to date.

## Current Projects üöÄ

I'm currently involved in several exciting projects that blend security, development, and automation:

1. **Secure Notepad Chrome Extension** ‚Äì A lightweight, password-protected notepad designed for securely storing sensitive information. This project incorporates encryption mechanisms, local storage security, and an intuitive user experience to ensure data privacy.

2. **Personal Website & Blog** ‚Äì A Next.js and Vercel-hosted platform where I share technical insights, project updates, and cybersecurity topics. Built with MDX support for flexible content management and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive design.

3. **Home Lab & Security Testing** ‚Äì Continuously expanding and refining my home lab environment, which includes virtualized network security setups, malware analysis, and penetration testing exercises. This allows me to simulate real-world attack scenarios and enhance defensive strategies.

4. **Automation & Scripting** ‚Äì Building tools to automate security tasks, log analysis, and incident response workflows using Python, Bash scripting, and PowerShell to improve efficiency in cybersecurity operations.

5. **T-Pot Honeypot Deployment** ‚Äì Implemented a T-Pot honeypot on DigitalOcean to collect and analyze malicious traffic. Integrated with Elastic Stack to visualize attack patterns, log analysis, and intrusion attempts, providing valuable insights into real-world threat intelligence.

## Outside of Tech

I love collaborating with others, whether it‚Äôs through hackathons, coding competitions, or cybersecurity challenges. There‚Äôs nothing better than working alongside passionate people, solving complex problems, and sharing knowledge.

One of my favorite ways to give back is by mentoring students in cybersecurity, especially in Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. In March 2025, I‚Äôll be involved with Zero Days and CTF schools, helping students navigate security challenges, think critically, and grow their skills.

For me, technology is all about community‚Äîlearning together, pushing boundaries, and helping others grow.
